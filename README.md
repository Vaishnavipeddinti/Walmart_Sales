# Walmart_Sales

In this project, I performed an extensive sales analysis for Walmart using a dataset spanning the years 2011 to 2015. The project was executed using Power BI and involved multiple stages of data preparation and visualization to derive actionable insights.

Key Steps and Features:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Cleaned the raw CSV file by addressing missing values and ensuring consistency across fields.

Created new calculated columns, such as:-

Year: Extracted from the order date to allow year-wise filtering and analysis.

Delivery Time: Computed as the difference between the ship date and order date, providing insights into delivery efficiency.

Data Analysis:-

Sales and Profit Trends: Analyzed total sales, profits, and quantities sold across multiple years to identify growth trends.
Category-wise Insights: Segmented sales and profit data by product categories to uncover high-performing and underperforming segments.
Geographical Analysis: Visualized profit and loss distributions across states using a map and bar charts to pinpoint regional performance.

Visualizations:-

Developed an interactive dashboard with dynamic slicers (e.g., year and category filters) to enable granular exploration.
Incorporated various charts like pie, treemap, and bar charts to present a clear breakdown of profits, sales, and losses.
Utilized a map to illustrate city-wise sales distribution.

Business Insights:-

Identified top-performing categories and states contributing significantly to overall profits.
Highlighted states with significant losses, such as Arizona and Oregon, for further investigation.
Assessed delivery efficiency using average delivery times to identify areas for logistics improvement.
